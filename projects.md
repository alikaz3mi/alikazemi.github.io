## Featured Projects

Here is a collection of some of the key projects I have worked on, showcasing my skills in AI, NLP, product management, and scalable system design.

### [Family Accounting](https://github.com/alikaz3mi/family-accounting)

**Objective**: Build a family-oriented accounting system with support for group financial management, loan tracking, and member categorization. The system is accessible via Telegram and Streamlit, with built-in SMS authentication for security.  
**Technologies**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Streamlit, Langchain (OpenAI Integration)  
**Outcome**: Delivered a secure, user-friendly system with clean architecture, capable of managing family accounts in real-time.

### License Plate Recognition

**Objective**: Develop and deploy a highly efficient license plate recognition system, improving both accuracy and speed to meet real-time processing needs on edge devices.  
**Technologies**: TensorRT, Python, Docker, Jetson Nano, Jetson NX  
**Outcome**: Reduced latency from 300ms to 25ms, achieving 95% accuracy. The model was deployed on Jetson Nano and NX, with 3-5 FPS on Jetson Nano and 8-12 FPS on Jetson NX.

### People Counting System

**Objective**: Develop a scalable people-counting system for multi-camera surveillance applications, with zone-specific accuracy and real-time performance.  
**Technologies**: YOLOx, TensorRT, Celery, Redis, Docker, Python  
**Outcome**: Increased counting accuracy by 25% and reduced system latency to 1.5ms. The system was successfully deployed across multiple cameras using Nvidia Docker, improving real-time zone-specific counting.

### Doctorate Resume Analysis (NLP)

**Objective**: Build an NLP-based system to extract key information from doctors' websites, including question-answering and document layout analysis.  
**Technologies**: LayoutLMv3, SerpAPI, Python  
**Outcome**: Achieved an 83% accuracy rate with a latency of 200ms. The system processed inputs like doctor names and countries to generate outputs with 30 distinct fields, reducing client query response time by 30%.

### Vanguard AI Surveillance System

**Objective**: Develop an AI-based surveillance system capable of handling multiple streams and integrating face recognition, people counting, and license plate recognition in a unified platform.  
**Technologies**: Python, GStreamer, PostgreSQL, Django, Vue.js, TensorRT  
**Outcome**: The system can handle 1000 frames per second (equivalent to streaming from 12 cameras) and record/log 10,000 events per second. This solution improved resource efficiency by 35% and cut hardware costs by 30%.

### AshenasAI (eKYC Service)

**Objective**: Build an AI-driven electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) service, including modules for 3D video face verification, signature verification, and liveness detection.  
**Technologies**: Python, gRPC, FastAPI, Docker, Redis, Celery  
**Outcome**: Optimized for real-time performance, processing five verification modules within 20 seconds. The system resulted in a 50% improvement in scalability and reduced development time from three months to two weeks.

### SensoChat

**Objective**: Develop an AI-powered chatbot capable of answering customer queries using information extraction and large language models (LLMs).  
**Technologies**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Python, NLP, Docker, CI/CD  
**Outcome**: Increased customer query resolution rate by 45%, handling up to 2000 requests per minute on a 4-core CPU with 8GB of RAM. The delivery time of the chatbot was reduced from 1 week to 5 minutes, with setup costs lowered by 96%.
